        "ingredients": [
            "2 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt",
            "Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg",
            "1 tablespoon semolina flour, plus more for dusting",

            "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil",
            "Filling (see Notes)"
        ],
        "steps":[
            "In a food processor, pulse the flour with the salt, nutmeg and the 1 tablespoon of semolina. Add the eggs and pulse until incorporated. With the machine on, add the olive oil in a thin stream and process just until moistened crumbs form. Turn the crumbs out onto a semolina-dusted work surface and knead just until a smooth dough forms. Wrap the dough in plastic and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.",
            "Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces and cover with plastic wrap. Work with 1 piece at a time: Flatten the dough into a 5-by-4-inch oval, about 1/2 inch thick. Dust lightly with semolina. Roll the dough through a hand-cranked pasta machine at the widest setting. Fold the dough in thirds (like a letter), then run it through the machine at the same setting, folded edge first. Repeat the folding and rolling once more. Roll the dough through at successively narrower settings, two times per setting, until it is thin enough for you to see the outline of your hand through it. Lay the dough out on a work surface lightly dusted with semolina.",
            "Brush any semolina off the dough. Select a shape from three options:",
            "For sun-shaped ravioli: Cut a sheet of dough in half crosswise. On one half, spoon 10 mounded teaspoons of filling in 2 rows of 5, about 3 inches apart; cover with the second half. Press out any air around the filling. Using a 2 1/2 - inch round cookie cutter, cut out the ravioli. Make “rays” around the edges with the tines of a fork.",
            "For square-shaped ravioli: Cut a sheet of dough in half crosswise. On one half, spoon 10 mounded teaspoons of filling in 2 rows of 5, about 3 inches apart; cover with the second half. Press out any air around the filling using a fluted pastry cutter or a sharp knife, cut between the mounds to form squares.",
            "For half-moon-shaped ravioli: Don’t cut the sheet of dough. Spoon 10 rounded teaspoons of filling 3 inches apart in a single row along the center. Fold the dough over the mounds. Press out any air around the filling, then press the edges to seal. Using a fluted pastry cutter or a 2 ½-inch round cookie cutter, cut out half-moons.",
            "Transfer filled and cut ravioli to a large rimmed baking sheet lightly dusted with semolina. Repeat with the remaining pasta dough and filling.",
            "In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook half of the ravioli over high heat until al dente, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the ravioli to a platter. Repeat with the remaining ravioli and serve."
